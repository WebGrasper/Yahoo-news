                        or news flash, is a current issue that broadcasters feel warrants the interruption of scheduled

                        Born and raised in Queens, New York City, Trump graduated from the Wharton School of the
                        University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in 1968. He became president of his father
                        Fred Trump's real estate business in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization. Trump expanded
                        the company's operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf
                        courses. He later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name.</p>
